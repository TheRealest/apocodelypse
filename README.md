# apo*code*lypse

A post-apocolyptic resource management game played through a terminal by writing snippets of code.

To start the app use:

```
npm run serve
```

The console has a small text box at the bottom for command entry. Just type your command in the form `<command> <flags> <args>` and hit enter to submit. Flags can be either short (a single letter preceded by a dash, like `-a` or `-s`) or long (a word preceded by a double dash, like `--fast`). Short flags can be combined in the form `-as`. Arguments are separated by a space. Use the `help` command to get started.
